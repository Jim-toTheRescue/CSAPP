This is a toy program to achieve the functionality of transferring file through Internet using socket.
In the server end, compile the recvfile.c and run the executable file.
In the client end, compile the sendfile.c and run the executable file.
For now:
In the client end, when the execuatable file is running, if no error printed, then the client is connected
to the server, and the file can be sent using the following steps:
1:key in the directory of the file to be sent, then enter. Then the file will be in the buffer zone waitting to 
be sent.
2:key in "send", then the file will be sent and print how many bytes are sent.

This is a small program, and I write it only to learn some computer stuff.
